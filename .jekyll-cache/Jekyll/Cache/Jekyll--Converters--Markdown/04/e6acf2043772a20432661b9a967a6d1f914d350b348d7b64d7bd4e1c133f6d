I"§<p>There are many memorable days in this short week, especially today. You can celebrate the great achievements of our country or your party, but it is more important to remember how many heartbreaking and tragic events are behind it. The anniversary is not a tool used by dictators to demonstrate their status and power but to remember those who were treated unfairly and made efforts and sacrifices for a better society.</p>

<p>In todayâ€™s authoritarian and totalitarian society, it is surprising that praising the dictator for not being loud enough and even just remaining silent is considered a crime, not to mention the illusion that he himself would have an ounce of sympathy for those who have suffered injustice or even paid with their lives, that is impossible.</p>

<p>People should remember more of those who contributed and paid the price for our present society in the past and not let their sacrifices go to waste.</p>
