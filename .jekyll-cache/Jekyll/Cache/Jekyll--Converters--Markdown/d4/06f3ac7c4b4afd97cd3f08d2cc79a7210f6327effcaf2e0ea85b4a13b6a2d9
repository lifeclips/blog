I"¹<p>I feel despondent and disappointed but not angry about what happened in Chengdu recently. Living in a place where you canâ€™t speak, see or hear any truth, itâ€™s no wonder why the people have little desire to live nowadays.</p>

<p>How can people feel free in an environment where life is highly authoritarian and opaque? The most interesting thing is that they also have a pro-people word in their official name.</p>

<p>I can feel that, in fact, most of us are aware of the harshness of the current environment and what has been taken away from us. Itâ€™s just that under high pressure, we have to cooperate with HIM as a qualified actor. I am one of them too.</p>

<p>It is what it is.</p>
