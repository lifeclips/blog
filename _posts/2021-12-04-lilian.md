 *Lyrics by Song, Dong-Ye (P.R. China)*  
 *词 宋东野（中国）*  

The loner started a journey, she found  
她發現孤獨的人準備動身  
And in the darkness of the dusk, she prayed  
於是就禱告著黃昏  
Deep in the night she turned and heard  
直到夜里她轉頭聽見  
a desperate groan  
悲傷的嗚咽  
A loving lady  
一個善良的女子  
and her long hair  
長髮垂肩  
Along with the steps of the dusk,  
她已跟隨黃昏  
she came  
來臨  

And her jade green clothes, in the fire,  
翠綠的衣裳在爐火中  
were merely ashes and dust  
化為灰燼  
The fire lighted the night,  
升起火焰一直燒到  
until dawn  
黎明  
Until the lady  
一直到那女子  
dashed towards the door  
推開門離去  
She whispered  
她自言自語  

"Far away from where I stand,  
在離這很遠的地方  
there is a beach  
有一片海灘  
My loner, he's at sea,  
孤獨的人他就在海上  
under sail  
撐著船帆  
If you see him  
如果你看到他  
on the shore  
回到海岸  
Please tell him your name  
就請你告訴他你的名字  
and my name  
我的名字  

Lilian"
