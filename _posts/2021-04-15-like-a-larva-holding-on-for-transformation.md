*By [Chen, Yi-Wen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yi-wen) ([Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan))*🇹🇼

I would like you to  
firmly resist your weakness  
like a chrysalis holding back a butterfly, a  
maple leaf resisting the autumn  
a newly splashed  
droplet resisting breakup   

I would like you to  
balance your inner beauty  
like the structure of a snowflake, the four   
petals of a finger tree flower  
a quatrain on a yellowed paper scroll:  
"a still night, an empty spring mountain"  

I would like you to  
tolerate the secrets of a narcissus  
forgive the twists of a moonlit river  
look straight at the murky sky as rain falls down  
just like listening to a naked prayer  
like the ocean  
embracing the absolution of a storm    

Then, maybe you would be willing  
to walk through a declining border town  
through a prosperous metropolis  
see life, see death  
see all the bustle and transience  
dignity and cold lifelessness    

Sometimes, life is  
as quietly beautiful as a poem, as desolate as a vine  
as intense as a soaring eagle  
as lonely as a dust-covered stele    

And so time passes, places alter, faces change  
it has been a long journey  
we return to the room we set off from  
origin and destination curl into a perfect ring    

I shall recognize the look in your eyes after calibration:  
clear, unswerving  
like steel beads that do not rust  
roundly, in a dark room  
reflecting pure light

**像蛹忍住蝶**  
*陳依文（臺灣）*

我想請你  
堅強地忍住脆弱  
像蛹忍住蝶，楓葉忍住秋天  
新濺下的  
一枚水滴忍住破散    

我想請你  
平衡內在的美麗  
如雪花的結構、流蘇的四瓣  
泛黃的紙卷上  
夜靜春山空的一首五絕    

我想請你  
寬容一株水仙的祕密  
原宥一條月江的曲折  
直視陰雨直落的灰霾天空  
如同傾聽一句赤裸的禱詞  
像海洋  
擁抱一場暴風雨的告解

然後，或許你願意  
走上沒落的邊城  
繁華的都心  
看看生，看看死  
看看一切熱鬧與無常  
尊嚴與肅殺    

生命有時  
靜美如詩，荒涼如蔓  
激越如鷹翱翔  
寂寞如碑蒙塵    

至末時移、境遷，容顏更改  
旅途得很久了  
我們回到出發時的房間  
原點與終點繞成完美的環

我將認出你標定後的眼神  
洗鍊貞定  
如不鏽的鋼珠  
圓整地，於暗室中  
反射出簡淨的光芒
