## A lecture on poetry writing

*Sunday 29 June 2014*

**During the 45th Poetry International Festival in Rotterdam, festival poet Hu Xudong (China) delivered a Master Class on writing poetry. You can find his speech in written form below.**

It's really very weird that a Chinese poet comes here to share his experience of poetry writing with Dutch audience, speaking in neither Chinese nor Dutch. Poetry is like a tropical jungle with the richest linguistic bio-diversities in the geography of its own language, but in the territory of another language, it might turn to be a desert. I don't think I can say something essential about poetry writing in my poor English, those tiny miracles hidden beneath the words, those unexpected storms among the tones are unwilling to dwell in a language used only for fundamental communications.
 
However, I'm not the kind of poet who deeply believes that poetry is something lost in translation. Sometimes I find that poetry might gain more in translation, and misreading or misunderstanding might be unintentionally creative. That's why I decided to be here with you, talking about poetry. Furthermore, there are other things as important as our maternal language in poetry writing, for example, the notions of what is poetry, life experience and the necessity of internal life, our feeling / emotion / perception / cognition under a certain social-historical context. These factors nowadays become more and more commensurable between us, since the monster of globalization devours us from different corners of the world into the same stomach of modernity or contemporaneity.
 
Before sharing the experience of how to write poems, I'd like to ask you, why do you want to write poetry? I guess the answers could be so diversified like images in a kaleidoscope. Personally I always consider two lines from Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska's poem 'Possibilities' one of the best answers for this question.

>*I prefer the absurdity of writing poems*  
>*to the absurdity of not writing poems.*
 
Yes, writing poems seems to be quite absurd compared with signing a commercial contract or attending a chic party with celebrities. But if you once experienced the great pleasure and the highest liberation of your inner world in writing poems, you will understand why the rational life is much more absurd than this suspicious behavior called poetry writing.
 
I would like to talk about some aspects of poetry writing by means of reading some excellent poems. First, I'm going to share a poem of Brazilian modernist poet João Cabral de Melo Neto with you. The title of this poem is, by chance, 'Poem'. We'll read the English version of this poem which is translated by an American Poet Laureate, W.S. Merwin:
 
>**Poem**  
>*By João Cabral de Melo Neto (Brazil)*  
>*Translated by W. S. Merwin*
> 
>My eyes have telescopes  
>trained on the street  
>trained on my soul  
>a mile away.  
> 
>Women come and go swimming  
>in invisible rivers.  
>Cars like blind fish  
>compose my mechanical visions.  
> 
>For twenty years I've not said the word  
>I always expect from me.  
>I´ll go on indefinitely gazing  
>at the portrait of me, dead.  

The reason I choose this poem to explain how to write poetry lies in the first stanza, especially the metaphor "telescope". Telescope is an instrument for observing something from a long distance, but in this poem João Cabral integrates telescopes into his own physical eyes and uses those inner telescopes to spy on something should be very close to him (street) or even inside him (soul). In his literary view he invents a long distance (a mile away) between himself and those proximate or inside stuffs. It means, he wants to keep distance from every acquainted thing and wants to be a sober and neutral observer of his daily life, even of his mental world. This is exactly the first suggestion I'd like to give for the beginners of poetry writing. To write poems you should observe everything clearly, but your sight of observation may not be the reflection in the mirror with the same shape and same size in the reality. Try to watch all the things you are familiar to in a new way, from a discreet distance, like an investigator, a spy sent by sort of intentional curiosity.
 
You may ask me, "How can I keep a distance from myself?" A good option is to use your inner telescope to observe something in your memory. They might be some scenes in your childhood; naturally they have a time distance from your actual life. You can write those scenes with abundant details as if you are investigating your past from your present. Details, specific names of specific things, precise description of the location, environment, physical action and psychological activity are of great importance of poetry writing. Poems are not abstract clouds that always float on the high sky; they need to glide down to earth to get enough concreteness as their energy. Here we have a good example of this principle, 'Death of a Naturalist', one of the very early works of the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who had performed at Rotterdam festival several times before he died last year:
 
>**Death of a Naturalist**  
>*By Seamus Heaney (Ireland)*
>
>All the year the flax-dam festered in the heart  
>Of the townland; green and heavy headed  
>Flax had rotted there, weighted down by huge sods.  
>Daily it sweltered in the punishing sun.  
>Bubbles gargled delicately, bluebottles  
>Wove a strong gauze of sound around the smell.  
>There were dragon-flies, spotted butterflies,  
>But best of all was the warm thick slobber  
>Of frogspawn that grew like clotted water  
>In the shade of the banks. Here, every spring  
>I would fill jampots full of the jellied  
>Specks to range on the window-sills at home,  
>On shelves at school, and wait and watch until  
>The fattening dots burst into nimble-  
>Swimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how  
>The daddy frog was called a bullfrog  
>And how he croaked and how the mammy frog  
>Laid hundreds of little eggs and this was  
>Frogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too  
>For they were yellow in the sun and brown  
>In rain.    
>  
>Then one hot day when fields were rank  
>With cowdung in the grass the angry frogs  
>Invaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges  
>To a coarse croaking that I had not heard  
>Before. The air was thick with a bass chorus.  
>Right down the dam gross-bellied frogs were cocked  
>On sods; their loose necks pulsed like snails. Some hopped:  
>The slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat  
>Poised like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting.  
>I sickened, turned, and ran. The great slime kings  
>Were gathered there for vengeance and I knew  
>That if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.  

In this poem, Seamus Heaney dealt with a very interesting experience in his childhood which might arouse lots of similar memories in the mind of every reader. The speaker narrated in the first stanza how he collected frogspawn and how he learnt some scientific knowledge with frogspawn in the primary school, it's very common all over the world. Then in the second stanza, the speaker gives us a horrible scene about how a little child was frightened by the real, noisy, vivid, dynamic, aggressive frogs far out of the classroom. You can take this poem as a chronicle of a psychological transition, occurring in the growing process of every child when he confronts the unpleasant and unknown reality which cannot be explained by what teachers taught to him. The word "death" in the title refers to this transition; it's the metaphysical death of the innocence of the "pure" childhood. After this metaphysical death we start to know "the dark side of the moon". Exploring writing materials in your memory of childhood is an efficient way for starters, because our childhood memory is always full of details. These details can provide a firm base of a poem. You might find that, in 'Death of a Naturalist', Seamus Heaney described everything with accuracy, the name of plant, the characteristic of swampy area, the sense of smell, the auditory / tactile sense, the behaviors of frogs, and even the name of the teacher. Rich details in a poem will not drive us mad; on the contrary, they will recall more sympathy from our own memory.
  
Sometimes you may be tired of writing the full-length process of a specific event, scene or other kinds of experience; you want to write something more subtle, something more related to your little emotion, your inexplicable mood. To this case, my advice is that, of course, emotion and mood can be direct materials for poetry, but even they might be very obscure. When you write them, try to make them as clear as possible, try to find some concrete substance in order to give the invisible mentality an appreciable container, a controllable form. Otherwise you are not able to prevent the intemperate dark flood of emotional expression; it will destroy your original writing intention and drag your words into a wasted land of all kinds of clichés. Remember that: don't write those emotional elements directly until you are ready to avoid superficial sentimentalism. Here is an excellent example of how to express pure emotional stuffs in a substantial way, a short poem 'One Art' written by American poet Elizabeth Bishop:
 
>**One Art**  
>*By Elizabeth Bishop (USA)*  
> 
>The art of losing isn't hard to master;  
>so many things seem filled with the intent  
>to be lost that their loss is no disaster.  
>   
>Lose something every day. Accept the fluster  
>of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.  
>The art of losing isn't hard to master.  
> 
>Then practice losing farther, losing faster:  
>places, and names, and where it was you meant  
>to travel. None of these will bring disaster.  
>   
>I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or  
>next-to-last, of three loved houses went.  
>The art of losing isn't hard to master.  
>   
>I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,  
>some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.  
>I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.  
>   
>—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture  
>I love) I shan't have lied.  It's evident  
>the art of losing's not too hard to master  
>though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.  
 
Elizabeth Bishop is very famous for putting a distinct visibility and legibility into lyric voice. We have all experienced the nightmare of losing personal belongings. It absolutely leads to a very bad mood, mingled with such gloomy emotions as frustration, self-accusation, sorrow, depression, and nostalgia. If you directly write down this vague mental situation ("Oh, How stupid I am! Oh, Why God is so unfair to me!"), your poem will not be more valuable than a post on Twitter. Elizabeth Bishop employed an ironically lyric tone to drive the complex of losing into a significant paradox. She didn't vent anger or express sorrow in an excessive way. Instead of that, she calmly set a series of specific things to hold on this strong but ambiguous emotion, from door keys, mother's watch, houses to river and continent, at last to "you". It's a progressive sequence, and gives a wonderful rhythm to reveal the complicated mentality.
 
Many beginners of poetry writing may take it for granted that poetry needs a special language higher than their daily language. When they write, they prefer to use lots of flowers of speech, lots of decorative words to make the poem more "poetic". That's totally not a good idea. I do think when you become a skillful poet; you can develop a personal lexicon with many unusual vocabularies, but most great poets only use daily language during their entire writing career. Actually modern or contemporary poetry is a way of saying, its poetic effect depends less on the traditional "beauty" of literary language than the particular state of consciousness beneath the simple language. Sometimes the language can be as simple as a cup of water. Let's read a poem of Constantine Cavafy, a Greek poet lived in Alexandria, Egypt:
   
>**The Windows**  
>*By Constantine Cavafy (Greece / Egypt)*  
>*Translated by Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard*  
>   
>In these dark rooms where I live out  
>empty days, I circle back and forth  
>trying to find the windows.  
>It will be a great relief when a window opens.  
>But the windows are not there to be found—  
>or at least I cannot find them. And perhaps  
>it is better that I don't find them.  
>Perhaps the light will prove another tyranny.  
>Who knows what new things it will expose?    
 
Did you find any difficult word, any flower of speech in this poem? Its linguistic simplicity guarantees the clarity of Cavafy's profound skepticism. The whole poem is just like an ordinary person talking to himself in a quiet tone, with a very plain expression. However, the last two lines are so powerful that you will never forget such a serene depression after reading.
  
Now I'd like to ask you to move back to the metaphor "telescope" at the beginning of my lecture. I've suggested you to observe your life from a certain distance. Let's go further. Did you ever imagine what might happen if you put the telescope upside-down, and turn yourself to be the object of observation? Can you imagine that some higher existence, some mysterious thing is observing you through the same telescope at the same time you are observing your writing materials? Here is short poem of a great Mexican poet, Octavio Paz:
 
>**Homage to Claudius Ptolemy**  
>*By Octavio Paz (Mexico)*  
>*Translated by Eliot Weinberger*  
>   
>I am a man: little do I last  
>and the night is enormous.  
>But I look up:  
>the stars write.  
>Unknowing I understand:  
>I too am written,  
>and at this very moment  
>someone spells me out.  
 
When the speaker in this poem (the astronomer Claudius Ptolemy) was looking up at the night sky, trying to explore some mystery, he suddenly realized that the stars were writers who wrote a vast, unknown text, including him, as a tiny code, and an anonymous reader from the sky was reading him. This poem may help you to practice the poetic imagination. Everybody knows imagination is the essence of the poetry. They may think it's very abstruse. However, imagination is not hard to master; you just need to think about a common scene reversely.
  
I'm going to conclude my lecture with the poem 'A Tale', by another Polish poet, Zbigniew Herbert. The title of my lecture comes from this poem. It's sort of meta-poetry, which means it is a poem about poetry or the poet itself. I will not analyze it, since this poem is very easy to understand, as are the other poems I shared with you today. I only want to say that, after reading it, I hope you will better comprehend the diversity of poetry and the pride of being a poet: 

>**A Tale**  
>*By Zbigniew Herbert (Poland)*  
>*translated by Czeslaw Milosz and Peter Dale Scott*  
>  
>The poet imitates the voices of birds  
>he cranes his long neck  
>his protruding Adam's apple  
>is like a clumsy finger on a wing of melody  
>
>when singing he deeply believes  
>that he advances the sunrise  
>the warmth of his song depends on this  
>as does the purity of his high notes  
>   
>the poet imitates the sleep of stones  
>his head withdrawn into his shoulders  
>he is like a piece of sculpture  
>breathing rarely and painfully  
>   
>when asleep he believes that he alone  
>will penetrate the mystery of existence  
>and take without the help of theologians  
>ternity into his avid mouth  
>  
>what would the world be were it not filled with  
>the incessant bustling of the poet  
>among the birds and stones
