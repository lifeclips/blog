I'm going to college again in a few days.

My roommate is gay. He told me that so straight away on the first day we met and that was the first line he said. I was amazed at his courage to tell his deepest secrets directly to a stranger he had just met for a few minutes. He said he just wanted to live a simple life and didn't want to hide anything, and if I couldn't accept that, then he wouldn't care.

Seeing him so courageous and frank, after thinking about it again and again, I told him that I was gay too. But I told him that I didn't have the courage like him. I had to consider the eyes of people around me. I didn't dare to speculate on who could accept me and who could not and I even dared not tell my own parents.

He has a beautiful relationship that lasts for six years, and this is something I didn't even dare to think about. I envy him, but I know I canâ€™t make a life choice like him. I just can not.
