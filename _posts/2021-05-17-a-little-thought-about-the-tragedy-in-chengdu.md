What happened to the student and the final results are not about what is finally announced, nor the CCTV camera system has malfunctioned even nowadays under the big data of AI-controlled society, nor whether there is a &#8220;The Top One&#8221; presiding the justice, but about in this very today of 2021, their first idea about things happened is still covering it up. In the face of public suspicion, there is not any independent and convincing third-party investigation. The truth is still determined only by the â€‹&#8221;stability first&#8221; policy, which began decades ago.

In today&#8217;s modernized economy, PRC is not North Korea or Cuba, so why should the media be tightly controlled? Why should people&#8217;s daily communication and public opinion be monitored and censored by big data? Where is the self-confidence of the system of our great nation that propagandized everywhere? The supporters have always desperately defended the ruler but despised his so-called compatriots. They have forgotten why few countries around the world have such censorship and control. In their eyes, the people were only worthy of being supervised, censored, and indoctrinated information.

This is not normal at all.

A group of investigative journalists who were active during the Hu and Wen period has now disappeared. The media has not dared to question it anymore. In the 80s, the National People&#8217;s Congress was able to summon and interrogate officials, but 40 years later now, it shows &#8220;there will never be judicially independent.&#8221; The next-door Korean film and television dramas tirelessly tell the stage of judicial justice. The death of Freud was broadcast on TV 24 hours a day. When will it appear in our country?

Independent and impartial investigations will not bring about a color revolution but will rally people&#8217;s hearts. The GFW blocks external information, and strict censorship of media statements also controls internal information. Without the right of supervision, the people can let the power hide dirt and accept wrongdoing, especially at a local and small place. Where there is darkness, there needs to be power to resist it.

Open-source code is more robust. This is the simplest truth.
