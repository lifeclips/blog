My eyes have telescopes

trained on the street

trained on my soul

a mile away.

<br>

Women come and go swimming

in invisible rivers.

Cars like blind fish

compose my mechanical visions.

<br>

For twenty years I've not said the word

I always expect from me.

I'll go on indefinitely gazing

at the portrait of me, dead.

<br>
