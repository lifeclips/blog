You can't be angry here  
Otherwise  
You will be in anger all the time  
And anger won't help  
Except Faint proof that  
Your heart has not yet  
Turned into iron  
Into concrete  
Into plastic, or whatever  
So what do you do?  
That's right, she's not you  
You wake up on a warm morning  
There's no chain around your neck  
Last night you weren't among the people fleeing  
No bombs flying in your sky  
The flowers in your window greet spring like they used to  
But right now you feel  
It's a shame to be happy  
It's a shame to live quietly
