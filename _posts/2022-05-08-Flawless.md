*Speech by [Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimamanda_Ngozi_Adichie)*

We teach girls to shrink themselves  
To make themselves smaller  
We say to girls  
"You can have ambition  
But not too much  
You should aim to be successful  
But not too successful  
Otherwise you will threaten the man"  
Because I am female  
I am expected to aspire to marriage  
I am expected to make my life choices  
Always keeping in mind that  
Marriage is the most important  
Now marriage can be a source of  
Joy and love and mutual support  
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage  
And we don't teach boys the same?  
We raise girls to see each other as competitors  
Not for jobs or for accomplishments  
Which I think can be a good thing  
But for the attention of men  
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings  
In the way that boys are  
Feminist: the person who believes in the social  
Political, and economic equality of the sexes
