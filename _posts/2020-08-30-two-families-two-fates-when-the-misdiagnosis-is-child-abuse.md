<p><strong>The power of child-abuse pediatric specialists and parents' unequal journey toward justice</strong></p>

* <u>pediatric</u> n. the branch of medicine concerned with children and their diseases
* <u>specialists</u> n. a person who is an expert in a particular area of work or study

"My baby is not breathing," Josue Santiago told the Racine, Wisconsin, 911 operator. "Oh my God, man, please send somebody. Please. Elihu. Elihu," he said, repeating his son’s name.

Until moments before the call, April 11, 2017, had been unremarkable in Santiago’s household. He got home from his night shift at a foundry and took over child care from his girlfriend, the baby’s mom, Glendalyz Galarza, as she went to work. He spent the day feeding and playing with Elihu, walking the dogs, drinking coffee, and texting with Galarza. Take the meat out of the freezer, she reminded him. Santiago worried about Elihu, though, texting Galarza that the baby was sleeping a lot and wasn’t hungry. In the afternoon, he took a photo of Elihu, and remembers thinking the four-month-old didn’t look like himself, looked too serious.

* <u>foundry</u> n. a factory where metal or glass is melted and made into different shapes or objects

Then, just before 5 p.m., Santiago flopped down on his and Galarza’s bed to sleep and pulled Elihu’s bassinet close. "I lay down," he told me when we spoke last year. "Something told me,Get up." His voice slowed and lowered. "And when I get up and look at him, he’s pale. His lips were purple." As he talked, Santiago clasped and unclasped his hands, his eyes wet. "He was shaking."

* <u>bassinet</u> n. a small bed for a baby, that looks like a basket
* <u>pale</u> adj. having skin that is whiter than usual because of illness, a strong emotion, etc.
* <u>clasp</u> adj. to hold sth tightly in your hand

Santiago picked him up, ran downstairs, and splashed water on the baby’s face: no response. He called 911, and an ambulance sped Elihu to a hospital.

* <u>splash</u> v. to fall noisily onto a surface
* <u>sped</u> past tense (past participle) of 'speed'

Several months later and one state over, in a quiet Illinois suburb, Molly Hayes, a dentist, and Daniel Namie, an engineering salesman, brought their three-month-old son, Alex, home after four weeks in the hospital.

They’d thought they were being overly cautious when they first brought him to the ER, after he started wheezing and seemed to swallow milk wrong. Doctors didn’t know what the problem was, but it was getting worse.

* <u>wheeze</u> v. to breathe noisily and with difficulty

Hayes and Namie were praying in a waiting room when doctors stepped out of Alex’s hospital room. The baby’s heart had stopped, they said. Hayes collapsed to the ground. Namie made himself enter the room, a priest accompanying him. "I thought that was it," Namie told me. "I kissed him on the forehead, and I was so happy to feel that he was still warm when I kissed him." The priest quietly baptized the baby with a syringe of water. Namie stumbled out and joined his wife on the ground in the waiting room, praying.

* <u>collapse</u> v. to fall down or fall in suddenly, often after breaking apart

A few minutes later, the doctors came out. Hayes thought they were going to say the time of death. They didn’t. Alex’s heart was beating, slowly.

Doctors transferred Alex to Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago, where he underwent a battery of treatments. About a month later, on October 20, Alex was stable enough to go home, although with a feeding tube, an oxygen machine, and instructions for how to monitor his oxygen levels. Hayes had recently gone back to work at the dental practice, while Namie had quit his job to care for Alex. But on October 26, Alex’s oxygen levels plummeted, and he was rushed to a local hospital.

* <u>undergo</u> v. to experience sth, especially a change or sth unpleasant
* <u>a battery of</u> phr. a large number of things or people of the same type
* <u>instruction</u> n. detailed information on how to do or use sth
* <u>plummet</u> v. to fall suddenly and quickly from a high level or position

Within hours of bringing their children to the hospitals, each family’s life would change. Both sets of parents would eventually lose custody of their child. One parent would be jailed. One baby would live. One baby would die. And both children’s cases would turn on the diagnosis of a child-abuse pediatrician, an increasingly powerful medical specialty. These doctors are trained in diagnosing child abuse, in writing reports meant to hold up in court, and in providing testimony on behalf of state prosecutors. Many of their salaries are paid, in part, by the child-welfare departments charged with separating parents and children. The doctors’ opinions can be subjective and powerful, even overruling other specialists’. But none of the parents knew that child-abuse pediatricians existed—not even as they talked with them, unwittingly sharing information that became a part of a case against them.

* <u>custody</u> n. the legal right or duty to take care of or keep sb/sth
* <u>testimony</u> n. a thing that shows that sth else exists or is true
* <u>in behalf of sb</u> phr. in order to help sb
* <u>on behalf of sb</u> phr. on sb's behalf as the representative of sb or instead of them

"Every word we used showed up in court," Hayes told me.

Child abuse is a pervasive and complex problem: Few children or abusers report harm themselves, so it’s up to other authorities, such as medical personnel and teachers, or bystanders, such as neighbors, to report suspected abuse. Some 3.5 million children in America were reported as being suspected victims of child abuse in 2018, the most recent year for which data are available; about 680,000 were ultimately determined by authorities to have been abused or neglected.

* <u>pervasive</u> adj. existing in all parts of a place or thing; spreading gradually to affect all parts of a place or thing
* <u>suspect</u> v. to have an idea that sth is probably true or likely to happen, especially sth bad, but without having definite proof
* <u>determine</u> v. to discover the facts about sth; to calculate sth exactly
