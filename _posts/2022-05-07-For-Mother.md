Tomorrow is Mother's Day, but the day before Mother's Day I saw another life pass. One by one, the passing lives seemed to give me a different feeling and a peaceful reflection. I also seem to feel the peace, relaxation and freedom of the future for them, and they will no longer have to suffer in this world.

Whenever people on the Internet say, "You are not afraid of death, are you still afraid of living?" Of course, there is no real empathy in the world. As far as I'm concerned, I don't criticize or support the actions they choose, I'm just happy for them, their choice was a courageous step, courage I never had, and I'm relieved for them. The world is impermanent, I have not experienced their life, I have not experienced their torment, naturally I can't comment on their choices. I just envy them for having such courage. Indeed, when I got to the same position in person, I didn't take that step, and I turned around crying and ran back, and no one knew. Continue to live according to the perspective of ordinary people, and continue to do everything that has nothing to do with me.

I don't know who I am, and I don't know who I live for. But I think mother is always the default option, I love my mother very much.

In recent years, I have been instilling various ideas of "modern independent women" into my mother. For example, if she can have her own life, I encourage her to get out of that unhappy marriage, go to another city to relax, find her own feeling, make herself more integrated into the modern society, and stop doing what he can't for the man she doesn't like. Comprehension is worthless. My mother deserves her own life, a life that is free, understood, and respected, without having to do more things that go against the heart for those who don't know how to be grateful. I often encourage her, go, live for yourself, don't be submissive to others, throw away any people and things you can't stand, and find your own happiness.

This year's Mother's Day is also the first "celibate" Mother's Day in the true sense of my mother. She lives alone in another city, happy or sad. I hope she is happy. I hope that I can accompany her, but unfortunately, she still has her studies in her body and cannot achieve it, but then I think that she also has her own social circle in another city, she has her own friends to talk to, and has her own world that she can use freely. Maybe she doesn't need my company at all that she has never had and experienced in the past. My company has restrained her hard-won freedom for her, and perhaps I was also a part of her. Thinking of this, I also found an excuse for my absence. I called my mother with peace of mind and expressed my complete support for her.

I don’t know if the foreshadowing I’m making now is to make my mother adapt more quickly to my continued absence in the future. I know that this is a huge blow to a mother. I don’t know how to make up for it, and I don’t know how to mitigate it. influence, but I believe that anyone should live only for themselves, and it is fragile to rely on others as the meaning of one's life. No one can't give up, no one can affect me. I hope my mother likes and accepts the philosophy of life I want to convey to her.

I am such a terrible son.
