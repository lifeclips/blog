    <p>I feel despondent and disappointed but not angry about what happened in Chengdu recently. Living in a place where you can’t speak, see or hear any truth, it’s no wonder why the people have little desire to live nowadays.</p>

<p>How can people feel free in an environment where life is highly authoritarian and opaque? The most interesting thing is that they also have a pro-people word in their official name.</p>

<p>I can feel that, in fact, most of us are aware of the harshness of the current environment and what has been taken away from us. It’s just that under high pressure, we have to cooperate with HIM as a qualified actor. I am one of them too.</p>

<p>It is what it is.</p>

    <p>I would like you to</p>

<p>firmly resist your weakness</p>

<p>like a chrysalis holding back a butterfly, a maple leaf resisting the autumn</p>

<p>a newly splashed</p>

<p>droplet resisting breakup</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I would like you to</p>

<p>balance your inner beauty</p>

<p>like the structure of a snowflake, the four petals of a finger tree flower</p>

<p>a quatrain on a yellowed paper scroll:</p>

<p>“a still night, an empty spring mountain”</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I would like you to</p>

<p>tolerate the secrets of a narcissus</p>

<p>forgive the twists of a moonlit river</p>

<p>look straight at the murky sky as rain falls down</p>

<p>just like listening to a naked prayer</p>

<p>like the ocean</p>

<p>embracing the absolution of a storm</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Then, maybe you would be willing</p>

<p>to walk through a declining border town</p>

<p>through a prosperous metropolis</p>

<p>see life, see death</p>

<p>see all the bustle and transience</p>

<p>dignity and cold lifelessness</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Sometimes, life is</p>

<p>as quietly beautiful as a poem, as desolate as a vine</p>

<p>as intense as a soaring eagle</p>

<p>as lonely as a dust-covered stele</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>And so time passes, places alter, faces change</p>

<p>it has been a long journey</p>

<p>we return to the room we set off from</p>

<p>origin and destination curl into a perfect ring</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I shall recognize the look in your eyes after calibration:</p>

<p>clear, unswerving</p>

<p>like steel beads that do not rust</p>

<p>roundly, in a dark room</p>

<p>reflecting pure light</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>旅途得很久了</p>

<p>我們回到出發時的房間</p>

<p>原點與終點繞成完美的環</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我將認出你標定後的眼神</p>

<p>洗鍊貞定</p>

<p>如不鏽的鋼珠</p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/2021/03/23/i-love-reading-blogs.html">I love reading blogs</a></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I love reading blogs, especially their About Me pages. By browsing other people’s stories and feeling the path of their lives, I can rethink myself differently.</p>

<p>I am a small-town boy. Unlike those boys who seem to be lively, I am not too interested in most things. Even with some of the popular recreational activities, I also quickly get bored. When it came to studying, it’s the same. I know that learning is fundamental, especially in the Chinese college entrance examination environment. But I don’t think I work very hard, and I keep on the benchmark line for every subject to avoid failing. But all in all, in the end, I was admitted to a university that was not very good but only around the baseline.</p>

<p>I was muddled and unsure of the future direction at that time. Unlike the exciting college life of others, mine seems unusually plain. Going to class, eating, and sleeping it’s the same things every day.</p>

<p>Similarly, after graduating with not particularly outstanding but ordinary grades, I ended my university life. Then I have worked in a typical company for about a year. Even if this job was not what I like, I can adapt quickly and adjust to the normal state.</p>

<p>Just in a random early morning, there was no one on the street. I was on my way to work, and I closed my eyes and listened to the music in my headphones. Suddenly at that point, I seemed to realize that every day for the past year has been the same, just repeating itself over and over again. I was shocked, and I find that I only live for one day and the rest 70 years of my life are just repetitions.</p>

<p>At that time, I decided to change my current life, but I didn’t know what part of my life should be changed. After a couple of days of considering, I chose to continue studying, even though I wasn’t sure I was really interested in it. Anyway, I quickly quit this job and prepared to apply to graduate schools.</p>

<p>Time seems to have returned to the high school study time, and the same repetition happened again. Studying, eating, sleeping, day by day. But during that time, a friend accompanied me to study together, and it seemed that my life routine had changed a little bit.</p>

<p>After several months of preparation, I was successfully admitted to a graduate university. And I will be starting my further study career in September this year. It seems that everything is going well now, but I feel that my future life will still be as repetitive and uninspiring as before.</p>

<p>Let me talk about other things. My age and family may ask me to live according to the life path they set for me, but I know I will let them down one day in the future. When they see that I will not marry a woman and may not have children, I wonder if my daily life will change? You wonder why? Because I like men and I am gay. And being gay is not allowed in China.</p>

<p>I always strangely feel scared and peaceful at the same time.</p>

<p>And there are some collections I explore more blogs:</p>

  </div>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I don’t know when our relationship faded. Maybe I wasn’t your best friend, but you were my best. Maybe not that accident, we will not change, not as cold as now.</p>

<p>Remember the old you, cheerful, lively, never sad about miscellaneous things. Look at your back, looking at your arms, are so charming. I missed that moment when you carried me on your back; I missed that smile when you fed me; I missed that sincerity when you talked about the problem for me. I and you, the alternation of hearts, is the basis of our friendship.</p>

<p>I have few friends. I remember meeting you in the heavy rain at the beginning of high school without knowing you, and you smiled at me, and I was hooked. Although I didn’t share a table with you during the three-day entrance education, I always looked back at you and sitting in the first row. I just made a terrible impression on the teacher. At the time of enrollment, the teacher said, “xx! I used to have a student named xx, so <em>Tian</em>!” At first, I didn’t understand, but then I realized that <em>Tian</em> meant naughty. The next day, I was warned by the teacher, but it didn’t help, I still looked at you. After a few weeks, finally, I sat behind you, looking at the gray hair on your head. I think it is also too hard to study, perhaps like me, and because of the miss. Another chance coincidence, I became a table with you, always passive I also took the initiative to approach you, do the usual table will do things, you like to stay up late, and sometimes doze off, I became your little sentry. Although I do not stay up late, I also have the habit of dozing off, but looking at you sleeping, I no longer want to sleep. At that time, we were inseparable, perhaps the closest friends in the world. I saw you as loving as a lover. I laughed with you and cried with you, even though you never cried.</p>

<p>I tell you everything about me, and you tell me your sorrows. I understand you, but you can’t see through me, and I don’t know if that’s why we’re estranged. Fate ran out, and you were placed in the top left corner of the classroom while I was in the top right corner. I panicked, and for some reason, I also privately begged the teacher to move me back, even if it was just a little closer, a little closer. You quickly made new friends, and the extremely introverted me was at a loss for words. My new deskmate was nice and civil, except that my thoughts of you had long since drowned out the sound of his voice calling me. Mornings, afternoons, any time we were supposed to be together, we went nowhere. Our communication, movements, and even eyes are less and less, gradually fading away, far away. Now you, more and more gray hair, I know you still like to stay up late, but you never dozed off again while I was in place, fell asleep, and never woke up. I know we can’t go back; I hope you’re well; I wish you happiness.</p>

<p>Some people say that a friend is a lover, the meaning of a friend is a relative, and a friend is a very person in front of you. The only thing in front of me is a white mist that envelops my eyes, and I can’t look at your face again.</p>

<p>I only wish you happiness, health, and going well.</p>

    <p><strong>The power of child-abuse pediatric specialists and parents’ unequal journey toward justice</strong></p>

<font size="2">By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD</font>

<ul>
  <li><u>pediatric</u> n. the branch of medicine concerned with children and their diseases</li>
  <li><u>specialists</u> n. a person who is an expert in a particular area of work or study</li>
</ul>

<p>“My baby is not breathing,” Josue Santiago told the Racine, Wisconsin, 911 operator. “Oh my God, man, please send somebody. Please. Elihu. Elihu,” he said, repeating his son’s name.</p>

<p>Until moments before the call, April 11, 2017, had been unremarkable in Santiago’s household. He got home from his night shift at a foundry and took over child care from his girlfriend, the baby’s mom, Glendalyz Galarza, as she went to work. He spent the day feeding and playing with Elihu, walking the dogs, drinking coffee, and texting with Galarza. Take the meat out of the freezer, she reminded him. Santiago worried about Elihu, though, texting Galarza that the baby was sleeping a lot and wasn’t hungry. In the afternoon, he took a photo of Elihu, and remembers thinking the four-month-old didn’t look like himself, looked too serious.</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>foundry</u> n. a factory where metal or glass is melted and made into different shapes or objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, just before 5 p.m., Santiago flopped down on his and Galarza’s bed to sleep and pulled Elihu’s bassinet close. “I lay down,” he told me when we spoke last year. “Something told me,Get up.” His voice slowed and lowered. “And when I get up and look at him, he’s pale. His lips were purple.” As he talked, Santiago clasped and unclasped his hands, his eyes wet. “He was shaking.”</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>bassinet</u> n. a small bed for a baby, that looks like a basket</li>
  <li><u>pale</u> adj. having skin that is whiter than usual because of illness, a strong emotion, etc.</li>
  <li><u>clasp</u> adj. to hold sth tightly in your hand</li>
</ul>

<p>Santiago picked him up, ran downstairs, and splashed water on the baby’s face: no response. He called 911, and an ambulance sped Elihu to a hospital.</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>splash</u> v. to fall noisily onto a surface</li>
  <li><u>sped</u> past tense (past participle) of ‘speed’</li>
</ul>

<p>Several months later and one state over, in a quiet Illinois suburb, Molly Hayes, a dentist, and Daniel Namie, an engineering salesman, brought their three-month-old son, Alex, home after four weeks in the hospital.</p>

<p>They’d thought they were being overly cautious when they first brought him to the ER, after he started wheezing and seemed to swallow milk wrong. Doctors didn’t know what the problem was, but it was getting worse.</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>wheeze</u> v. to breathe noisily and with difficulty</li>
</ul>

<p>Hayes and Namie were praying in a waiting room when doctors stepped out of Alex’s hospital room. The baby’s heart had stopped, they said. Hayes collapsed to the ground. Namie made himself enter the room, a priest accompanying him. “I thought that was it,” Namie told me. “I kissed him on the forehead, and I was so happy to feel that he was still warm when I kissed him.” The priest quietly baptized the baby with a syringe of water. Namie stumbled out and joined his wife on the ground in the waiting room, praying.</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>collapse</u> v. to fall down or fall in suddenly, often after breaking apart</li>
</ul>

<p>A few minutes later, the doctors came out. Hayes thought they were going to say the time of death. They didn’t. Alex’s heart was beating, slowly.</p>

<p>Doctors transferred Alex to Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago, where he underwent a battery of treatments. About a month later, on October 20, Alex was stable enough to go home, although with a feeding tube, an oxygen machine, and instructions for how to monitor his oxygen levels. Hayes had recently gone back to work at the dental practice, while Namie had quit his job to care for Alex. But on October 26, Alex’s oxygen levels plummeted, and he was rushed to a local hospital.</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>undergo</u> v. to experience sth, especially a change or sth unpleasant</li>
  <li><u>a battery of</u> phr. a large number of things or people of the same type</li>
  <li><u>instruction</u> n. detailed information on how to do or use sth</li>
  <li><u>plummet</u> v. to fall suddenly and quickly from a high level or position</li>
</ul>

<p>Within hours of bringing their children to the hospitals, each family’s life would change. Both sets of parents would eventually lose custody of their child. One parent would be jailed. One baby would live. One baby would die. And both children’s cases would turn on the diagnosis of a child-abuse pediatrician, an increasingly powerful medical specialty. These doctors are trained in diagnosing child abuse, in writing reports meant to hold up in court, and in providing testimony on behalf of state prosecutors. Many of their salaries are paid, in part, by the child-welfare departments charged with separating parents and children. The doctors’ opinions can be subjective and powerful, even overruling other specialists’. But none of the parents knew that child-abuse pediatricians existed—not even as they talked with them, unwittingly sharing information that became a part of a case against them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>custody</u> n. the legal right or duty to take care of or keep sb/sth</li>
  <li><u>testimony</u> n. a thing that shows that sth else exists or is true</li>
  <li><u>in behalf of sb</u> phr. in order to help sb</li>
  <li><u>on behalf of sb</u> phr. on sb’s behalf as the representative of sb or instead of them</li>
</ul>

<p>“Every word we used showed up in court,” Hayes told me.</p>

<p>Child abuse is a pervasive and complex problem: Few children or abusers report harm themselves, so it’s up to other authorities, such as medical personnel and teachers, or bystanders, such as neighbors, to report suspected abuse. Some 3.5 million children in America were reported as being suspected victims of child abuse in 2018, the most recent year for which data are available; about 680,000 were ultimately determined by authorities to have been abused or neglected.</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>pervasive</u> adj. existing in all parts of a place or thing; spreading gradually to affect all parts of a place or thing</li>
  <li><u>suspect</u> v. to have an idea that sth is probably true or likely to happen, especially sth bad, but without having definite proof</li>
  <li><u>determine</u> v. to discover the facts about sth; to calculate sth exactly</li>
</ul>
