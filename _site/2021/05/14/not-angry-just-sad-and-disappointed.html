      <p>I feel despondent and disappointed but not angry about what happened in Chengdu recently. Living in a place where you can’t speak, see or hear any truth, it’s no wonder why the people have little desire to live nowadays.</p>

<p>How can people feel free in an environment where life is highly authoritarian and opaque? The most interesting thing is that they also have a pro-people word in their official name.</p>

<p>I can feel that, in fact, most of us are aware of the harshness of the current environment and what has been taken away from us. It’s just that under high pressure, we have to cooperate with HIM as a qualified actor. I am one of them too.</p>

<p>It is what it is.</p>
